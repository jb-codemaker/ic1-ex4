Good intro overall...  A few critiques...

There were a few typos... "git add remote"... 
Also, it was unclear whether 'user-name' meant user-name or 'user-name' ... (i.e. should we include the quotes?)...
Also, I was unable to find the "Meet Git" videos or any of the others...
Also, it would have been neat to push the 2ndfavorite branch as well as the master to explore that more.

Thanks for the awesome intro!
